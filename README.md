# todo-list

FEATURES

- A list
- Each item on the list has a title, description, due date, and priority
- Can have separate/multiple todo lists for organizing stuff
- Can view all of the items from different lists

## UNFINISHED PROJECT. WILL FINISH SOON BECAUSE MY MOTIVATION IS DRAINING

### Lacking features:

- To be able to delete projects
- To be able to edit todos

### To improve:

- Code organization (very messy)
- Instead of putting the items of a project into an array, put it into an object and make the title as the key


I want to be able to redesign the program because it's a mess, but that would mean I have to start from scratch which I do not want to do as of this moment.
But somewhere in the future, I will come back to this project and finally finish it.

Otherwise, this program is fully functional without errors.
